# _Pizza Order Delivery_

#### _Allows a user to create an order for pizza delivery, Friday,January 27,2017_

#### By _SHRUTI PRIYA_

## Description

_This web application will gather input from the user (name, address, and pizza specifications) to order pizzas and calculate the final cost depending on their choices made.The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of Object Oriented Programming in Javascript, including the use of constructors and the use of object.prototype.method to add methods to an object.

This project should :
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository to a local directory.
* Open index.html in a standard web browser.
* The details of this code on my Git hub account are as under: https://github.com/Shruti1808/Pizza-Order-Project.git

## Specifications :
 * Allow user to enter their information.
 * Allow the user to choose toppings(cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
  ** set regular price of different pizza size:
    * Cost of small pizza = $10
    * Cost of medium pizza = $15
    * Cost of large pizza = $20
    * Cost of extra-large pizza = $25
  ** set the price of toppings :
    * Cost of cheese topping = $2
    * Cost of artichoke topping = $3   
    * Cost of pepperoni topping = $5

  ** If they choose to order a small pizza with cheese topping, the total cost of the pizza would be
  Total cost = Price of small pizza + cost of cheese topping;

 **If they choose to order a small pizza with pepperoni topping, the total cost of the pizza would be
 Total cost = Price of small pizza + cost of pepperoni topping;

and so on.

** Offers a delivery option that requires address information from the user.
